## SETUP

### IDEs

- We like **Neovim** for quick editing of text and config files, scripts and programs, both on Linux and Windows platforms. Our setup is throughly described [here](https://github.com/pabloqpacin/dotfiles/tree/main/.config/nvim) but, in short, we beef it up with LSPs, DAPs and other quality plugins.
- Admittedly however, we are rather likely to be using **VSCodium**/**VSCode** given its extensibility and great features in regards to efficiency and customization. Our favourite plugins and settings can be found [here](https://github.com/pabloqpacin/dotfiles/tree/main/.config/code/User).
- Now when it comes to working with databases, we might to stick to IDEs like [foo](#) and [bar](#).

## Education

We are students based in Spain pursuing the [ASIR](https://todofp.es/que-estudiar/loe/informatica-comunicaciones/admin-sist-informaticos-red.html) Professional Certificate, which mostly covers sysadmin, netadmin, and a few other IT technician roles regarding INFOSEC, databases, web servers, etc.

Besides this formal education, we are doing HTB and more yay! <!-- TODO ASAP -->
